## Technologies

I used basic css over scss and less mixins/classes
Instead components have there own styles and are included when the component is rendered
This forces a component approach and protects against css becoming bloated and misused

[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
for getting going with a webpack build and service-worker

[semantic-ui-react](https://react.semantic-ui.com/introduction) for components that have dependencies besides react and a small style sheet

[basscss](http://basscss.com/) very small css package for general layouting
